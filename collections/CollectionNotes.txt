Concrete classes:

Maps:
HashMap
 - One null key and unlimited null values
Hashtable
 - Synchronized
 - No null keys or values
TreeMap
 - In Ascending key order
 - Sorted according to the natural order of the key's class or by a comparator.
 - Not synchronized.
LinkedHashMap
 - Subclass of HashMap
 - Predictable iteration order.

Sets:
HashSet
LinkedHashSet
TreeSet

Lists:
ArrayList
Vector
LinkedList

Queues:
PriorityQueue
 - Ordered by natural order or according to a Comparator.
 - Does not permit null elements.
 - When using natural ordering, does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects.
 - The head is the least element with respect to the specified ordering.
 - Ties are broken arbitrarily.
 - poll, remove, peek, and element access the element at the head of the queue.
 - The Iterator provided in method iterator() is not quaranteed to traverse the elements in any particular order.  use Arrays.sort(pq.toArray()) if you need ordering.
